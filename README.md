## 🎲Mods Used

This project uses basically all the projects from **Simply Optimized**, with some of my own additions! You can see all the mods under the dependencies section!

This project will frequently use unofficial/untested builds of mods, whether they might be official unstable builds or from PRs. The original projects will do be credited by being marked as **embedded**!

## 🤔FAQs:

> Why **Lavishly**?

As said before, this project will frequently use unofficial/untested builds of mods, to bring optimizations to snapshots, as soon as possible! This means that, these versions of the modpack may be very unstable! 

The optimizations will be ***lavishly*** unstable!

> Doesn't **HyperSoup** release their own snapshot builds?

Yes, they do! But these snapshots versions are released only when there's a lot of hype about these snapshots, and when the official Minecraft release is going to drop soon! It means that they release these builds when most mods available are mostly stable!

The _motto_ of this project is to release versions as soon as a new snapshot drops! Most of the versions of this project are not meant to be played in your main singleplayer world; but if you do want to, it is always recommended to make backups before updating!
